# Making NetCDF Files
In this Github I show the code I used to convert some Excel spreadsheets from the Rhode Island Department of Health (RIDOH) into NetCDF format to be put on the RIDDC ERDDAP server. Ella Wood, an undergraduate at Brown, did some work with the Excel spreadsheets in summer 2020.

DOH_2018_Moredims.ipynb is just an example that is fully commented, wasn't actually used for anything. The others are based on it, and were used for things, but are not fully commented.
